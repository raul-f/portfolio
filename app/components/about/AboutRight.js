				<h2 className='about-title'>Form equals function.</h2>
				<p className='about-text'>As a developer, that's my core philosophy: having your site be well-designed, usable, intuitive to navigate - and feel good - is just as important as it working properly.</p>
				<p className='about-text'>I'm a 21-year-old front-end web developer based in SÃ£o Paulo, Brasil. Besides design and coding, I love cats, birds, kids, story-driven video games and fashion. I have ADHD, and my friends say that most of the time my behavior is between that of a cat and a kid - but I'm always hyperfocused when designing or coding. Also, I'm a big fan of high-contrast, well-balanced two-color design - black and white design in particular.</p>
				<p className='about-text'>I should say that I have confidence in my CSS, SASS, HTML, JavaScript and React.js skills. I am also well-versed in Node.js, a prolific user of Git and Github, and I can work with D3.js, too.</p>
